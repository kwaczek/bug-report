## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-issue triage: AI runs before GitHub issue creation; spam is discarded without creating an issue
- Image hosting: ImgBB for MVP (simpler, fewer GitHub token scopes; switch to Contents API in v1.x if needed)
- Telegram library: telegraf 4.16.3 (better TypeScript types vs grammY)
- Local relay exposure: Cloudflare Tunnel preferred over ngrok (stable, free, permanent URL)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Ralph's fix_plan.md format and --monitor behavior must be confirmed from Ralph source before implementation begins
- Phase 3: ImgBB free tier rate limits are undocumented — test under load; have GitHub Contents API as fallback
- Phase 3: Cloudflare Tunnel vs ngrok decision must be finalized before relay server implementation
